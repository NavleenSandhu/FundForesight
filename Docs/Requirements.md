# Data Flow
**Client (Frontend) → API Gateway → Microservices → Database → Frontend.**

## Data Flow Overview
### 1. Frontend (Client-Side)
- **UI Interaction**: Users interact with the app (enter budgets, log transactions, view reports).
- **API Requests**: The app makes HTTP requests to the backend using REST or GraphQL.
- **Example**: When a user submits a new budget, the app sends an HTTP POST request with the budget data to the backend API.

### 2. API Gateway (Optional)
- API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests. It routes the requests to the appropriate microservice.
- **Security**: Can handle authentication, rate limiting, and load balancing.
- **Example**: The API Gateway validates the user's token, then forwards the budget request to the Budgeting Service.

### 3. User Service (Authentication)
- **Login/Registration**: Users authenticate with the app, and a JWT token is issued.
- **Token Validation**: This token is used for future requests (e.g., budget submissions, transactions).
- **Database**: The User Service stores user credentials, preferences, and profile information in the database (e.g., PostgreSQL).

### 4. Budgeting Service
- **Create/Edit/Delete Budgets**: Manages CRUD operations for user budgets.
- **Business Logic**: 
  - Ensure that budgets align with user income, financial goals, and past spending trends.
  - Automatically notify users if they exceed their budget.
- **Data Storage**: Budgets are stored in a PostgreSQL or other relational database, with tables for budgets, categories, and user-specific data.
- **Response**: The service returns the budget details to the frontend via the API Gateway.

### 5. Transaction Service
- **Log Transactions**: Allows users to log expenses and income. Transactions are linked to budgets and categorized.
- **Data Validation**: Validates that the transaction belongs to a valid category and doesn't exceed the budget.
- **Data Storage**: Stores transaction data, including amounts, dates, categories, and tags in the database.
- **Service Communication**: May call the Budgeting Service to check if a transaction impacts the user's budget.
- **Response**: Returns transaction details or status (success/failure).

### 6. Reporting Service
- **Generate Reports**: Generates monthly, quarterly, or annual reports based on the user's budget and transactions.
- **Business Logic**: 
  - Aggregate data from the Budgeting and Transaction Services to provide insights like:
    - Total spending per category.
    - Forecast based on historical trends.
    - Visualizations of budget vs. actual spending.
- **Data Storage**: May generate temporary data and use cache (e.g., Redis) for storing reports.
- **Response**: The service sends financial insights and graphs to the frontend for display.

### 7. Notification Service
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Sends notifications to users based on events (e.g., budget limit exceeded, upcoming bill reminders).
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Can subscribe to events from other services (like Budgeting or Transaction Services) and trigger actions accordingly.
- **Message Broker**: If needed, use a message broker like RabbitMQ for real-time communication between services.

### 8. Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL** is used as the primary database for all services, with separate schemas or tables for each service (e.g., users, budgets, transactions).
- **Database Models**: 
  - User Table: Stores user info, login details, and preferences.
  - Budget Table: Stores budget data (amount, category, user, etc.).
  - Transaction Table: Stores transactions linked to users and budgets.
- Microservices interact with the database through ORM libraries (e.g., TypeORM or Sequelize in Node.js, GORM for Go, ActiveRecord for Ruby).

# Step-by-Step Process to Proceed
## Design Data Models:
- Define schemas for user, budgets, transactions, etc., in PostgreSQL.

## Set Up Docker Containers:
- Dockerize each microservice (Node.js, Go, Ruby, etc.).
- Set up PostgreSQL in a Docker container.
- Use docker-compose to orchestrate containers and set up a Docker network.

## Build Each Microservice:
- Start by building the User Service for authentication (JWT-based auth).
- Build the Budgeting Service to handle CRUD for budgets.
- Implement the Transaction Service to handle user transactions and validate against budgets.
- Develop the Reporting Service to generate reports and insights.
- Optionally, add a Notification Service to send real-time alerts.

## Set Up Frontend:
- Use React Native to create the mobile and web apps.
- Integrate API calls using libraries like Axios or Fetch.
- Ensure that frontend components (screens for budgets, transactions, and reports) interact with the microservices via APIs.

## Testing and Integration:
- Test the integration between frontend and backend services.
- Write unit tests for backend services (e.g., using Jest or Mocha in Node.js).
- Use Postman or similar tools to test REST APIs.

## Deploy to Production:
- Deploy backend microservices using Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- Use AWS or Azure to host your services, along with PostgreSQL as a managed database.

# Security Components

## Authentication
- **Implementation**: User authentication is handled using OAuth 2.0, providing secure delegated access. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are issued upon successful authentication, which are then used for accessing protected resources.
- **JWT Tokens**: Tokens are signed and optionally encrypted. They include claims such as the user's identity, role, and expiration time. Tokens are stored securely on the client-side, typically in secure storage mechanisms (e.g., localStorage or Secure Enclave on mobile).

## Data Encryption
- **In Transit**: All sensitive data, such as authorization tokens, personal information, and financial details, is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security) during communication between the client and server.
- **At Rest**: Data at rest, including user information and financial records, is encrypted using AES-256 encryption in the database. This ensures that even if the storage is compromised, the data remains secure.
- **Token Encryption**: JWT tokens are encrypted when necessary, especially for sensitive scopes, to prevent tampering.

## Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access to resources and actions is governed by RBAC. Users are assigned roles (e.g., admin, user), and each role has specific permissions, limiting what they can access and perform within the app.
- **Granular Permissions**: Permissions are enforced at both the API level and within microservices, ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify data.
- **Scope-based Authorization**: For certain operations, additional scopes within the JWT token are required, ensuring that users can only perform actions they are specifically authorized for.

## Security Best Practices
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries are parameterized or use ORM libraries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**: Input sanitization and output encoding are implemented to prevent malicious scripts from executing in the browser.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**: Anti-CSRF tokens are embedded in forms and verified for state-changing requests to protect against CSRF attacks.
- **Password Storage**: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt or a similar algorithm, with a strong salt and multiple rounds of hashing.
- **API Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting and throttling are used to mitigate brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints and other critical areas.

## Audit Logs
- **Logging of Sensitive Actions**: All sensitive actions such as logins, password changes, role modifications, and financial transactions are logged for audit purposes.
- **Audit Trails**: Detailed logs include user ID, action type, timestamp, and any associated data changes. These logs are stored securely and can be accessed for compliance reviews or incident investigation.
- **Anomaly Detection**: The system monitors logs for unusual activities, such as multiple failed login attempts or large, unexpected transactions, and triggers alerts for potential security threats.
